## Julie's Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is written to be a re-usable single page app for displaying static content. Think personal website, resume, etc. Once you clone this project, all you need to do is update the App.js and AllPageContent.js files to suit your needs. You can also add new pages. Go to https://julieeast.com for a live example of the code.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

**Note: Remember to set the local environment variables or the contact page won't work!**

This project has an integration to Mailgun and the expected local environment keys need to be set for the "Contact" page to work properly. 
You will need to add your own environment variables that match your own Mailgun account settings so that it works for you.
